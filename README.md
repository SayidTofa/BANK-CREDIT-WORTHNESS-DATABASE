Project: Bank Loan Management System
## Project Description
The Bank Loan Management System is designed for FM Investment Banking to efficiently manage customer accounts, credit history, loan processing, and repayments. The database consists of structured tables that store customer details, loan applications, approvals, and repayment tracking, ensuring smooth financial operations and risk assessment.

## Project Objectives
Customer Management: Store and manage customer details, including contact information, account balance, and account type.
Loan Processing & Approval: Record loan applications with credit history verification for approval or rejection.
Repayment Tracking: Monitor and track loan repayments, including last deposit dates and outstanding loan amounts.
Financial Insights: Provide insights into customer borrowing behavior, risk levels, and financial health.

## Key Insights
Customer Credit History: Customers with a good credit history are more likely to get loan approvals, while those with a bad history are at a higher risk of default.
Loan Repayment Patterns: Customers who deposit funds regularly are more likely to maintain good repayment records.
Account Type Analysis: Different account types (savings/current) influence loan eligibility and repayment consistency.
Default Risk Management: Identifying high-risk customers based on late repayments and bad credit history helps in proactive risk mitigation.

## Recommendations
Strengthen Credit Assessment: Implement stricter eligibility criteria to minimize loan default risks.
Improve Loan Recovery Strategies: Offer incentives for timely repayments and enforce penalties for late payments.
Enhance Customer Segmentation: Use customer transaction data to offer personalized financial products and better lending terms.
Automate Risk Alerts: Set up automated notifications for overdue loans and upcoming repayment deadlines.
Encourage Savings Culture: Link loan eligibility to saving habits, ensuring financial discipline among customers.
